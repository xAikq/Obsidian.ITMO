### **Exercise 1.e**

- Muirhead though that the men had been washed away by an enormous wave.
- People reject his idea at the time.
- Now people think that small waves can combine to create a huge wave, which swept the men away.

### **Exercise 1.f**

1) A huge rock was lying on the steps leading up to the lighthouse, but it would have been too heavy for anyone to carry, so it adds evidence to the idea of the huge wave.
2) The ship **Queen Elizabeth II** was hit by a 100-ft wave in 1995, a modern example of Muirhead's theory.
3) A paper in a scientific journal has recently been published saying that monster waves really exist.
4) 1901 was the date when Muirhead actually solved the mystery, but then there was no proof.
5) There are some things we will never know the answers to.
